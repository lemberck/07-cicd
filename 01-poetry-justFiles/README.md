# "Sales Data Analysis Script with  Python Pandas and Justfile Automation"

### Script: `analyze_sales.py`

### Data : 'sales_data.csv'

### Tasks:

1. **Read Sales Data:**
   - Use the Pandas library to read the CSV file containing sales data.

2. **Simple Data Analysis:**
   - Calculate and print the total sales (Sold Quantity * Unit Price) for each product.
   - Calculate and print the total sales of the company.

3. **Script Execution Control:**
   - Implement `if __name__ == '__main__':` to ensure execution only when the script is called directly, not when imported as a module.

4. **Automation with Justfile:**
   - Create a Justfile with a rule named `analyze` that runs the `analyze_sales.py` script.

5. **Code Documentation:**
   - Adequately document the code, including explanatory comments.

### Final Steps:

- Execute the script in the terminal using the Justfile to verify correctness.
- Test the script's import in a Python environment to ensure analyses are not executed upon module import.
