For this project, it will be needed two Kubernetes Services â€” one for each Deployment (frontend and backend):

Frontend Service: The frontend application (Streamlit) needs a Service to be accessible to users. Since this is the user interface, it is required to expose it to the public internet. This could be done through a LoadBalancer type of Service in Kubernetes, which would provision an external IP that routes to the Streamlit application.

Backend Service: The backend application (FastAPI) needs a Service for the frontend application to communicate with it. This does not need to be exposed outside the cluster as it's only the frontend that needs to access it. A ClusterIP type of Service would suffice for this use case, as it would provide a stable internal endpoint for the frontend pods to send requests to (pod-to-pod intercluster communication)

In essence, the project is creating a microservices architecture where each part of the application has its own set of resources and can scale independently. This is a core principle in cloud-native application design and a foundational aspect of MLOps, focusing on modularity and scalability.

Frontend Service:
- Exposed to the public (LoadBalancer).
- Allows users to interact with the Streamlit UI.
- Maps the user requests to the Streamlit application's pods.

Backend Service:
- Only needs to be internal (ClusterIP).
- Provides a stable endpoint for the Streamlit application to send API requests.
- Ensures that requests to the FastAPI application can be load-balanced across the backend pods.

By separating these services, the independence of the frontend and backend applications is maintained, which is a best practice in both MLOps and microservices design. It also means that each part of the application can be updated or scaled without impacting the other, improving both maintainability and availability.
